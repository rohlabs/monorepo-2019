# Monorepo

This is a monorepo boilerplate for me (@rohmanhm). It is a starter monorepo comprised of TypeScript apps/packages, GraphQL server and an example deployment workflow.

## Overview

The repository is powered by Lerna and Yarn. Lerna is reponsible for bootstrapping, installing, symlinking all of the packages/apps together.

## Inspired

This project is inspired by PalmerHQ [monorepo-starter](https://github.com/palmerhq/monorepo-starter) project
